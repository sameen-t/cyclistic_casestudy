**Introduction** <br/>
In this case study I will be taking on the role of a junior data analyst at an imagined bike-share company called Cyclistic. The purpose of my role is to utilize raw data provided by Cyclistic to answer key business questions that will inform and guide marketing strategy. Throughout this project, I will be following the guiding steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. <br/><br/>

**Scenario**<br/>
Cyclistic is bike-share company that was established in Chicago in 2016. They offer over 5000 bikes that are geo-tracked and can be docked into any of the 692 bike stations established throughout Chicago. Customers can either purchase a single day or full day pass as ‘casual members’, or they can subscribe to an annual membership to become a Cyclistic ‘member’. Cyclistic sets itself apart by offering more inclusive options for riders with disabilities. However, the majority of riders (a whopping 92%) opt for the traditional bikes.<br/> 

Recently, Cyclistic’s financial analysts have determined annual members are more profitable than casual members. Based on this information, Lily Moreno, the director of marketing has set a goal to convert casual riders to annual members in order to maximize profits within the already established customer base. <br/>
 
In order to meet this goal, the marketing team needs data to understand how annual members and casual members differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media can affect marketing strategies. To do this, they have enlisted the help of my data analyst team to identify trends in Cyclistic historical bike trip data to inform their marketing strategies. Our task will be to provide meaningful data that can answer the marketing teams questions and guide them towards their goals. <br/>
