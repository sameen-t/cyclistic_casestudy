**Introduction**
In this case study I will be taking on the role of a junior data analyst at an imagined bike-share company called Cyclistic. The purpose of my role is to utilize raw data provided by Cyclistic to answer key business questions that will inform and guide marketing strategy. Throughout this project, I will be following the guiding steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
